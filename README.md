## üö® Troubleshooting

### Why aren't my notifications working?

**Problem**: The most common issue is that Windows Focus Assist (Do Not Disturb mode) automatically turns on while playing games, blocking all notifications.

**Solution**:
1. **Open Windows Settings** by pressing `WIN + I` or searching "Settings" from the Start Menu
2. **Navigate to System ‚Üí Focus assist** (alternatively, press `WIN + R` and run `ms-settings:quiethours`)
3. **Find the "Automatic Rules" section** - you'll see these options are enabled by default:
   - ‚úÖ "When I'm playing a game"
   - ‚úÖ "When I'm using an app in full screen mode"
4. **Disable both options** by clicking the toggle switches to turn them OFF
5. **Restart BitCraft Companion** to ensure changes take effect

**Additional Notification Troubleshooting**:
- Verify Windows notifications are enabled for the application in Windows Settings ‚Üí Notifications
- Test notifications using the "Test Notification" button in the BitCraft Companion Settings window
- Ensure your Windows sound is not muted (notifications include audio cues)
- Check that BitCraft Companion has notification permissions

### Other Common Issues

#### Windows Security Scanning
- **PyInstaller executables** may trigger Windows Defender scanning on first run
- **This is normal behavior** for compiled Python applications
- **Solutions**: Add BitCraft Companion to Windows Defender exclusions or run from source

#### Performance Notes
- **Large inventories** (1000+ unique items) may take a few seconds to load initially
- **Real-time search** is optimized but may slow slightly with very large datasets
- **Multiple claims** with extensive data may impact switching speed

#### Connection Issues
- **VPN interference**: Some VPNs may block WebSocket connections to BitCraft servers
- **Firewall blocks**: Ensure BitCraft Companion can access the internet
- **Server maintenance**: BitCraft server downtime will prevent data loading
