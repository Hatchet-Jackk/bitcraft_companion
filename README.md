### ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
#### üìã Why are my tables not loading?

This issue is still under investigation. Current findings suggest that slow or unstable internet connections can interrupt the WebSocket connection while the application loads reference data. If your tables are not loading, try waiting a few minutes‚Äîdata may eventually appear once the connection stabilizes.

**Tips:**
- Check your internet connection speed and stability.
- Restart BitCraft Companion if the issue persists.
- Avoid heavy network usage during application startup.
- If problems continue, report the issue with details about your network environment.

#### üí¨ Why aren't my notifications working?

**Problem:**  
Windows Focus Assist (Do Not Disturb mode) may automatically enable during gaming, blocking notifications.

**Solution:**  
1. Open **Windows Settings** (`WIN + I` or search "Settings" in the Start Menu).
2. Go to **System ‚Üí Focus assist** (or `WIN + R`, run `ms-settings:quiethours`).
3. In **Automatic Rules**, locate:
  - "When I'm playing a game"
  - "When I'm using an app in full screen mode"
4. **Disable** both options by toggling them OFF.
5. **Restart BitCraft Companion** for changes to apply.

**Additional Tips:**
- Ensure Windows notifications are enabled for BitCraft Companion (**Settings ‚Üí Notifications**).
- Use the "Test Notification" button in the app's Settings window.
- Confirm your Windows sound is not muted.
- Check notification permissions for BitCraft Companion.

#### üîÑ Why aren't my Traveler's Tasks updating?

BitCraft Companion syncs Traveler's Tasks in real time via the game servers. If the game isn't running or you're logged in with a different account, updates won't appear.

**Checklist:**
- BitCraft game is open and running.
- Logged in with the same account in both BitCraft and BitCraft Companion.
- After switching claims/accounts, wait a few seconds for sync.

**Still not updating?**  
Use "Force Refresh" in the Settings menu to reload claim and task data.

#### üåó Why doesn't the Light theme look right?

The Light theme is a work in progress. Some UI elements and colors may not display correctly. Improvements are planned for future releases.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Other Common Issues

**Windows Security Scanning**
- PyInstaller executables may trigger Windows Defender scans on first run.
- This is normal for compiled Python apps.
- To resolve: Add BitCraft Companion to Defender exclusions or run from source.

**Performance Notes**
- Large inventories (1000+ items) may take a few seconds to load.
- Real-time search is optimized but may slow with very large datasets.
- Switching between multiple claims with extensive data may be slower.

**Connection Issues**
- VPNs may block WebSocket connections to BitCraft servers.
- Firewalls may prevent BitCraft Companion from accessing the internet.
- BitCraft server maintenance can temporarily prevent data loading.
