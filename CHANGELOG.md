# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.27]
### Added
- **Enhanced Search with Keywords & Comparison Operators**: Revolutionary search system with keyword-based filtering across all tabs
  - **Keywords**: `item=`, `tier=`, `quantity=`/`qty=`, `tag=`, `container=`, `building=`, `crafter=`, `traveler=`, `status=`
  - **Comparison Operators**: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` for both string and numeric fields
  - **Multiple Conditions**: Support multiple conditions per field with AND logic (e.g., `item=log item!=package qty<500`)
  - **Examples**: `item=plank tier>3 qty<100`, `container=carving`, `building!=workshop`, `tier>2 tier<6`
  - **Smart Field Detection**: Automatically handles numeric vs string comparisons
  - **Backward Compatible**: Regular search terms still work alongside keywords
  - **Tab-Specific Placeholders**: Contextual search examples for each tab
  - **Container Search**: Special handling for searching within container dictionaries
  - **Traveler Tasks**: Enhanced nested search showing parent travelers when child operations match
